Survey site:

To test your chatbot application using Postman, especially when dealing with session-based interactions like surveys, you'll need to set up your requests carefully to mimic real user behavior. Postman is an excellent tool for this, as it allows you to manage sessions and inspect responses easily.

Here's a comprehensive guide on how to test your chatbot with Postman, handle survey questions, and understand session management, along with logging and data storage aspects.

Step-by-Step Guide for Testing with Postman
1. Setting Up the Flask Server
First, ensure your Flask server is running. You can start it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will run your Flask application locally, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. Creating Requests in Postman
2.1. Install Postman

If you haven't already installed Postman, download and install it from Postman's website.
2.2. Start a New Request

Open Postman and click on + New to start a new request.
Set the request type to POST.
Enter the URL of your Flask application, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/chatbot.
2.3. Setting Up the Headers

Set the Content-Type header to application/json. This tells your Flask application that you are sending JSON data.
2.4. Testing the Chatbot Endpoint

In the Body tab, select raw and enter your JSON input. For example, to start a conversation with a greeting:
json
Copy code
{
    "user_input": "Hello"
}
Click Send to execute the request. You should receive a response from your chatbot, such as:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "Hello! How can I assist you with your heart health questions today?"
}
2.5. Testing the Survey Flow

To test the survey feature, you'll want to simulate a user completing the survey over multiple requests. Here's how you can achieve that:

Start the Survey:

Create a POST request to the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:5000/start-survey.
Click Send. You should receive a response with the first survey question:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "We have a quick survey for you! What is your age?"
}
Answering Survey Questions:

You will need to simulate the user answering each question consecutively. This involves sending multiple POST requests to the http://127.0.0.1:5000/chatbot endpoint for each survey question.

For Question 1:

Set the Body to:
json
Copy code
{
    "user_input": "25"
}
Click Send. You should get a response with the next question:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "Thank you! Now, What is your gender?"
}
Continue this process for all survey questions. Each time you respond, the session should remember your progress and return the next question.

Completing the Survey:

Once you answer the final survey question, you should receive a confirmation message:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "Thank you for completing the survey! Your responses have been recorded."
}
Postman Session Management
To handle sessions in Postman effectively, you'll use cookies. Here's how to manage them:

Enable Cookies:

Postman automatically handles cookies, but you can view and manage them using the Cookies tab.
After your first request, Postman stores the session cookie. Make sure the "Preserve Session" option is enabled to maintain state across requests.
Verify Cookies:

Check if cookies are being sent with each request by inspecting the Cookies tab after each request.
You should see a session cookie from your Flask app.
Testing Flow in Postman
Here's a sequence of requests you can follow to simulate a complete user interaction, including handling FAQs and surveys:

Send Initial Greeting:

Request: POST /chatbot
Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "user_input": "Hello"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "Hello! How can I assist you with your heart health questions today?"
}
Start a Survey:

Request: POST /start-survey
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "We have a quick survey for you! What is your age?"
}
Answer Survey Questions:

Question 1:

Request: POST /chatbot
Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "user_input": "25"
}

    "response": "Thank you! Now, What is your gender?"
}
Question 2:

Request: POST /chatbot
Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "user_input": "Female"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "Thank you! Now, How would you rate your heart health on a scale of 1 to 10?"
}
Continue for all survey questions...

Complete Survey:

Final Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "response": "Thank you for completing the survey! Your responses have been recorded."
}
Logging and Data Storage
The chatbot code is designed to log interactions and store survey responses. Here's how it works:

Logging
The logging setup in your code will log all interactions to a file named chatbot.log.
Each user interaction, along with any errors, is logged for future analysis.
Example Log Entry:

yaml
Copy code
2024-07-24 12:34:56,789 - INFO - User input: Hello
2024-07-24 12:34:56,790 - INFO - Response: Hello! How can I assist you with your heart health questions today?
2024-07-24 12:35:01,234 - INFO - User input: 25
2024-07-24 12:35:01,235 - INFO - Response: Thank you! Now, What is your gender?
Data Storage
Survey responses are stored in the session dictionary, ensuring user data persists during the interaction.
At the end of the survey, responses can be logged, saved to a database, or written to a file.
Storing Responses in a File Example:

You can modify the handle_survey function to store responses in a file:

python
Copy code
def handle_survey(user_input):
    survey_state = session['survey']
    current_index = survey_state['current_question_index']
    
    # Store the user's response
    survey_state['responses'].append(user_input)
    
    # Check if there are more questions
    if current_index + 1 < len(survey_questions):
        survey_state['current_question_index'] += 1
        session['survey'] = survey_state
        next_question = survey_questions[survey_state['current_question_index']]
        return f"Thank you! Now, {next_question}"
    else:
        # Survey is complete
        survey_state['active'] = False
        responses = survey_state['responses']
        session['survey'] = survey_state
        
        # Log the responses
        logging.info(f"Survey completed with responses: {responses}")
        
        # Write responses to a file
        with open('survey_responses.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"Survey responses: {responses}\n")
        
        return "Thank you for completing the survey! Your responses have been recorded."
Handling Consecutive Survey Questions
In your Postman workflow, you need to ensure each survey question is answered one at a time. This involves manually sending each response and checking for the next question. However, you can automate this process using Postman Collections and Pre-request Scripts:

Automating Survey with Postman Collections
Create a Collection:

In Postman, create a new collection for your chatbot tests.
Add a Request for Each Question:

Add a separate request for each survey question.
Use Postman's Tests and Pre-request Scripts to automate the sequence.
Use Pre-request Scripts:

Store the current question index and responses in Postman variables.
Use these variables to iterate through survey questions automatically.
Example Pre-request Script:

javascript
Copy code
// Initialize or update the survey question index
let currentIndex = pm.environment.get("questionIndex") || 0;
pm.environment.set("questionIndex", currentIndex);

// Define survey questions
let surveyQuestions = [
    "What is your age?",
    "What is your gender?",
    "How would you rate your heart health on a scale of 1 to 10?",
    "Do you have any history of heart disease in your family?",
    "How often do you exercise in a week?"
];

// Set the current question
pm.variables.set("currentQuestion", surveyQuestions[currentIndex]);
Example Test Script:

javascript
Copy code
// Update question index and send the next question
let currentIndex = pm.environment.get("questionIndex");
currentIndex++;
pm.environment.set("questionIndex", currentIndex);

// Check if there are more questions
if (currentIndex < surveyQuestions.length) {
    let nextQuestion = surveyQuestions[currentIndex];
    pm.variables.set("nextQuestion", nextQuestion);
} else {
    // Complete the survey
    pm.environment.unset("questionIndex");
    pm.variables.set("surveyComplete", true);
}
Chain Requests:
Use the collection runner to chain requests based on the current question index.
Postman will automatically send the next request with the user's response, simulating the survey process.
Example Postman Collection Workflow
Here's an example of how you can set up the collection to handle survey questions automatically:

Initialize Survey:

Request: POST /start-survey
Pre-request Script: Initialize question index to 0.
Tests: Set the first question variable.
Answer Questions:

Request: POST /chatbot
Pre-request Script: Use the current question variable.
Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "user_input": "{{answer}}"
}
Tests: Update the question index, send the next question.
Run the Collection:

Use the Collection Runner to execute the requests in sequence.
Set initial values for environment variables (e.g., questionIndex and survey answers).
Conclusion
Testing your chatbot with Postman allows you to simulate real-world interactions, manage sessions, and ensure each feature works as expected. By setting up Postman requests and automating survey completion, you can efficiently test and refine your chatbot application.

This setup will help you identify any issues in the session management and survey process, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, by integrating logging and data storage, you can capture user interactions and survey results for further analysis or reporting.
