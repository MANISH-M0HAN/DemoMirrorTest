Detailed Explanation of the Bot's Working
This bot is a Flask-based web service that processes user inputs and generates relevant responses about heart health using a pre-defined dataset and the Gemini Generative AI model. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the bot works:

Imports and Initial Setup:

The bot imports necessary libraries for Flask (web framework), google.generativeai (for generating responses), SentenceTransformer (for embedding user inputs and database entries), SpellChecker (for correcting spelling errors), pandas (for handling CSV data), and numpy (for numerical operations).
Flask App Initialization:

A Flask app is initialized with a secret key for session management.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled to allow requests from different origins.
Model and Spellchecker Initialization:

The SentenceTransformer model paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 is loaded for generating embeddings.
The SpellChecker is initialized for correcting spelling errors in user inputs.
Gemini API Configuration:

The Gemini Generative AI model is configured using an API key stored in the environment variable GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY.
Loading and Preparing Data:

The heart_health_triggers.csv file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Any missing values in the DataFrame are filled with empty strings.
The DataFrame is converted into a list of dictionaries (database), where each dictionary contains a trigger word, its synonyms, keywords, and a corresponding response.
Embeddings are precomputed for trigger words, synonyms, and keywords, and stored in a list (db_embeddings).
Spelling Correction:

The correct_spelling function takes a text input, corrects any spelling errors using the SpellChecker, and returns the corrected text.
Finding Best Context:

The find_best_context function corrects the spelling of the user query, computes its embedding, and calculates cosine similarities between the query embedding and the precomputed embeddings in db_embeddings.
The function finds the best matching response based on the highest similarity score, provided it exceeds a threshold of 0.4.
Generating Response with Gemini:

The generate_response_with_gemini function uses the Gemini model to generate a response based on the provided prompt, with a maximum length of 150 words.
Getting Response:

The get_response function handles the overall logic for generating a response:
It first corrects the spelling of the user input.
If the input is a greeting (e.g., "hello", "hi"), it returns a standard greeting response.
Otherwise, it finds the best matching context from the database.
The context history is updated with the context and the user input.
A full prompt is constructed and passed to the Gemini model for generating a response.
The context history is updated with the generated response and truncated to the most recent 10 exchanges if necessary.
Flask Route for Chatbot:

The /chatbot route accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing the user input.
The route retrieves the user input, updates the session's context history, and returns a JSON response containing the bot's reply.
Running the App:

The Flask app is run in debug mode, making it available for testing and interaction.
