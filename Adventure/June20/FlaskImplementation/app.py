# Features of the Code
# Spell Correction:

# The correct_spelling method uses the SpellChecker library to correct any spelling mistakes in the user's input before processing it.
# Context Matching:

# The find_best_context method finds the most relevant response from a pre-defined set of responses stored in a CSV file. It uses the SentenceTransformer model to generate embeddings for the input query and compares it with the embeddings of pre-defined responses using cosine similarity.
# Response Generation:

# The generate_response method generates a response based on the current context and conversation history. It uses the transformers library with a pre-trained model (distilgpt2) to generate the response.
# Session Management:

# The Flask app uses session management to maintain the context history of the conversation. This is crucial for ensuring coherent and context-aware responses over multiple interactions with the chatbot.
# How It Works
# Initialization:

# The Flask app is initialized along with the necessary libraries and models.
# The CSV data is loaded, and embeddings are created for each text chunk (combining trigger words, synonyms, keywords, and responses).
# API Endpoint:

# A /chatbot endpoint is created to handle POST requests. This endpoint receives user input in JSON format.
# Processing User Input:

# When a request is received, the chatbot function retrieves the user input from the request.
# It checks the session for an existing context history. If none exists, it initializes an empty list.
# Spell Correction:

# The correct_spelling function corrects any spelling mistakes in the user input.
# Context Matching:

# The find_best_context function is used to find the most relevant pre-defined response based on the user's input. It computes the cosine similarity between the user input's embedding and the embeddings of pre-defined responses.
# Response Generation:

# If a relevant context is found, it is added to the conversation history.
# The generate_response function uses the updated context history to generate a response using the distilgpt2 model.
# If no relevant context is found, a fallback response is provided.
# Maintaining Context:

# The conversation history is maintained in the session to ensure context-aware interactions.
# The history is truncated to the last 10 exchanges to prevent it from growing indefinitely.
# Returning the Response:

# The generated response is returned to the client in JSON format.
# Techniques and Components Used
# Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

# Spell Correction: Enhances the understanding of user input by correcting spelling mistakes.
# Context Matching: Uses sentence embeddings to understand the semantic meaning of user inputs and find the best matching pre-defined context.
# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

# The code employs a form of RAG by first trying to match the user input with a pre-defined context (retrieval) and then generating a response based on this context (generation).
# Transformer Models:

# The SentenceTransformer model (based on BERT) is used for creating embeddings of sentences to find semantic similarity.
# The distilgpt2 model is used for generating responses. This model is a smaller, distilled version of GPT-2, optimized for generating coherent and context-aware text.
# Session Management:

# Flask's session management is used to maintain the conversation history across multiple interactions with the chatbot, ensuring that the chatbot can generate contextually relevant responses.
# Code Execution Flow
# User Input Received: The API endpoint receives the user input.
# Spell Correction: The input is processed to correct any spelling mistakes.
# Context Matching: The system searches for a relevant pre-defined response based on the semantic similarity of the input.
# Response Generation: If a context is found, it is used to generate a coherent response; otherwise, a fallback response is given.
# Context History Update: The conversation history is updated and maintained in the session.
# Response Sent: The generated response is sent back to the user.
# This structure ensures that the chatbot is not only able to understand and respond to user inputs effectively but also maintains a coherent conversation over multiple interactions, enhancing the user experience.
