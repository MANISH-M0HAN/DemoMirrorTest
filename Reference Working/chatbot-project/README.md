# Chatbot Project

This project demonstrates a simple chatbot that sticks to the viewport and handles basic interactions using a Node.js backend and a static frontend.

## Setup

2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `node server.js` to start the backend server.

### Frontend

1. Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

- The chatbot can respond to "Hi" and "Hey" with a predefined response.
- Type a message in the input field or click on the pre-typed buttons to interact with the chatbot.
